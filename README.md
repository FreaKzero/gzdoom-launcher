Currently gets rewritten in React and Electron because of abandonment/EOL of Angular 1.5 and NWjs.

My own Goals for this Rewrite: 
- Get as close as the original with the UI design
- Just scan 1 Folder and SSGL should figure the rest out, no differentiating between iWads and Wad Folders anymore
- Nicer and Simpler Codebase/Building as the old one
- "Own" Component/UI with animations (styled-components and Framer Motion)
- Better handling of Sourceports, user should be able to configure the Sourceport and parameters as he want
- "Fresh" Visual Design and possibility to change Wallpapers, roughly based on DOOM 2016 Design
- Nicer "Modlist" selection which is now called "Packages"
- In the long run: Controller Support
